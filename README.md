# ðŸ›’ Sales Data Analysis with SQLite & Python

This project demonstrates how to analyze simple sales data stored in an SQLite database using Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Project Overview

We use a small SQLite database (`sales_data.db`) with a `sales` table that contains:
- Product name
- Quantity sold
- Unit price
- Region
- Date of sale

From this data, we extract useful insights like:
- Total revenue and quantity sold per product and region
- Monthly revenue trends

---

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Create and populate a SQLite database
- Run SQL queries using `sqlite3` in Python
- Summarize sales by product and region
- Plot revenue using:
  - Grouped bar chart (by product and region)
  - Line chart (monthly revenue trend)
- Export visualizations as PNG files
